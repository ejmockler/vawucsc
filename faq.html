					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					</header>
					<ul>
					  <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>VAW@UCSC is a "medical outreach" club. Does that mean I have to be pre-med to join?</h4>
						<p>Absolutely not! We are a campus club focused on medicine and healthcare; we accept anyone with a mutual interest in health. If you can dedicate yourself to a worthy cause then you can most certainly join! This program gives anyone the oppurtunity to travel, meet great people, and experience a new culture.</p>
					  </li>
					  <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>The trips look cool, but they're really expensive.</h4>
						<p>We try to organize many fundraising events that go towards funding our trips. As college students, we all understand the struggles of living on your own and crying at everything being so ridiculously expensive. We really do not want anyone to keep themselves from such a great oppurtunity because of cost, so participate! </p>
					  </li>
					  <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>If I join, do I have to go on all the trips?</h4>
						<p>Not at all. You can still be a VAW club member and not go on the trips. Like any other member, it would expected that you still help out with VAW activities. You can save money you make from fundraising for a future trip!</p>
					  </li>
					   <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>How often and where are meetings hosted?</h4>
						<p>We hold two meetings per month, either in Oakes College or Carson College.</p>
					  </li>
				      <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>What do the meetings consist of?</h4>
						<p>At the meetings, we discuss projects, events, and fundraisers. We also host guest speakers, such as doctors,  EMT's, and professors. </p>
					  </li>
					  <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>What will I get to do on the trip?</h4>
						<p>As a team member, you will have the opportunity to shadow medical professionals, work side-by-side with experienced doctors, perform triage, manage a pharmacy, and teach public health classes to children and/or teenagers. Additionally, you will have free time to experience a new culture and build amazing long-lasting relationships! </p>
					  </li>
					  <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>Can I still make phone calls abroad?</h4>
						<p>Ensure your device is carrier-unlocked (able to accept SIM cards of a different carrier). Decide to pick up a SIM card in the host country to use, or contact your cell carrier for other options.</p>
					  </li>
					  <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>Is there WiFi in the areas we travel?</h4>
						<p>VAW volunteer houses provide wifi; host families may supply wifi or an ethernet cable. WiFi usually isn't hard to come across at cafes, restaurants, and hotels.</p>
					  </li>
					  <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>Will the food suit my dietary needs?</h4>
						<p> VAW is well-equipped to handle special dietary needs. While creating your Empowered account for fundraising, you will encounter a question on the application that asks about dietary restrictions and allergies; any information provided is received by in-country staff before arrival, and they make necessary arrangements. Diets excluding beef, pork, or seafood are supplemented with alternate foods; stricter diets, such as gluten-free and vegan diets, may require communicating with our kitchen staff/your host family upon arrival to ensure you have adequate and balanced food.</p>
					  </li>
					  <li>
						<input type="checkbox" checked>
						<i></i>
						<h4>How does currency exchange work during travel?</h4>
						<p>VAW strongly advises against exchanging money at the airport– you will typically get a very low rate. Upon arriving at the host community, your VAW Site Manager will take you to a local exchange house that has decent rates. ATMs are available if you wish to use your debit/credit cards, but know that there may be a 5%-10% withdrawal charge depending on your bank. Note that venues taking credit/debit cards tend to appeal to tourists and are more expensive.</p>
