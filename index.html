Outside of VAW, I enjoy playing many sports including soccer, running, and swimming. I also like to participate in half-marathons with my family. :) I've always strived to help the community, from hosting blood drives and canned food drives to organizing charity fashion shows.  I was drawn to VAW because of all the opportunities it offers. I began cultivating an interest in the STEM field in high school, taking all the science courses that they offered from AP Chem/Biology to anatomy. VAW will lead me to further explore my interests through its incredible internship opportunities, which will not only give me experience but will also open my eyes to the real world and teach me valuable life skills." data-balloon-pos="up">Elizabeth Hu</h3>

I am from a small town in southern California that values being there for one another and working together to help others achieve their goals. The city of Santa Cruz very much reminds me of my hometown because I noticed how every person looks out for one another out of the kindness of their heart, which is why I joined VAW in hope to also make a positive impact on my new home community and the locations around the world we shall travel to. When I am home from school I am back in my home town enjoying time with my family and working as an LA City lifeguard. Along with being the publicity chair of Volunteers Around the World, I am also on the UCSC Women's Club water polo team and volunteering with Bay View elementary school to tutoring children after school." data-balloon-pos="up">Vianne Kelly</h3>

Catch me behind a screen working this site, taking a photo somewhere, gutting a computer, or shredding these glorious Santa Cruz bike trails or a guitar. Sure, I might be a computer science major at UCSC hanging here with a bunch of bio majors-- but I see an awareness of healthcare & medicine as being invaluable for anyone to have. The emergent disparities between healthcare systems worldwide and at home is nothing to sleep easy over. VAW aims to close the gap, and sends us to communities in need with the tools we need to help. It’s a good thing to be a part of." data-balloon-pos="up">Eric Mockler</h3>

As a Human Biology major at UCSC, I seek to receive a higher education in order to pursue my passion for the medical field, and in turn, give back to communities around the world.

My hobbies include playing the clarinet, watching and performing in theater, and even traveling. I love seeing all that the world has to offer which is a big as to why I joined VAW. I can’t wait to see what this next year holds, because aside from traveling, I’m excited to learn and bring attention to different cultures and health disparities that most people aren’t aware of. Education, to even basic medical needs, are just a few of the services lacking from these underfunded communities.
