						<h2>About VAW@UCSC</h2>

					<p>Volunteers Around The World <a href="http://www.volunteersaroundtheworld.org" target="_blank">(VAW)</a> is a social enterprise and national organization devoted to improving the standard of living within poverty-stricken communities worldwide through means of medical outreach.</p> 
					<p>Our focus is to provide communities with access to medical treatment, medication, nutritional security, and clean water. VAW runs mobile clinics in underserved communities around the world, creating humanitarian initiatives that provides free primary health care and health education. This chapter at UCSC will continue to expand these projects, recruiting volunteers that are interested in visiting different countries to learn about new cultures, shadow doctors, and teach public health classes to children in vulnerable communities.</p>
					<p>VAW at UCSC emphasizes that members who go on trips will gain exposure to new cultures and experiences while helping those in more vulnerable parts of the world. As club members– including those who may choose to not go on the trips– we will always continue to spread awareness about these countries not having the medical necessities that we are capable of providing and raising money for. This does not in anyway devalue the imperative for medical assistance in communities around the United States, as we recognize that disparities in the healthcare system are ubiquitous. In addition to medical outreach abroad, VAW at UCSC extends its efforts into the local health care system here in Santa Cruz; reaching out to local hospitals and clinics.</p> 
					<h4>The Goal:</h4>
					<p>The goal is to juxtapose local and global perspectives, allowing us to paint a true image of health care as a whole. We highlight in our club's purpose that we as a community (and club) strive to better our understanding of cultures and knowledge needed in order to make a change.</p>
